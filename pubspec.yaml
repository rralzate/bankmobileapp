  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Lato
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Lato-Black.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Lato-BlackItalic.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Lato-Bold.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Lato-BoldItalic.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Lato-Italic.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Lato-Light.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Lato-LightItalic.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Lato-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Lato-Thin.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Lato-ThinItalic.ttf
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
